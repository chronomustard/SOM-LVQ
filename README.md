# SOM and LVQ MATLAB File Documentation

This documentation provides an overview and usage instructions for the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) MATLAB files. These files are useful for implementing and analyzing SOM and LVQ algorithms in MATLAB.

## SOM MATLAB File

### Description
The SOM MATLAB file (`SOMPudi.mlx`) contains functions for implementing the Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm in MATLAB. SOM is an unsupervised learning technique used for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data.

## LVQ MATLAB File

### Description
The LVQ MATLAB file (`LVQPudi.mlx`) contains functions for implementing the Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm in MATLAB. LVQ is a supervised learning technique used for classification tasks.
